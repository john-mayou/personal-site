## About Me

I’m deeply interested in building high-quality software in a collaborative team setting. Whether it's debugging production issues, writing new features, or migrating legacy code, I want to contribute wherever I can add value for the team.

Before tech, I worked in restaurants — always understaffed and high-pressure. It didn’t matter whose table it was, if something needed doing, it was your responsibility to handle it. That same mindset drives my approach to software: ownership, teamwork, and getting things done.

## Why I Left My Job to Buil

A few months ago, I left my job to double down on my learning. I built this site as if it were a real production site, complete with:

- High Test Coverage: Jest, Playwright, React Testing Library, Go
- CI/CD Pipeline: GitHub Actions, Docker, Terraform
- Metrics and Observability: Prometheus & Grafana
- Frontend: IDE-style Markdown editor w/ syntax highlighting
- Markdown Preview: Using a custom Markdown-to-HTML compiler written in Ruby

I’m still growing, but I consistently reflect and ship faster with high quality each iteration. I’d like to bring the same enthusiasm for learning to your engineering team, and make a meaningful impact.
